# Quiche lorraine

**Prep:** 20 min / **Cook:** 40 min

**Serves:** 6

## Ingredients

- 1 shortcrust pastry (homemade or store-bought)
- 200g smoked bacon lardons (or diced pancetta)
- 150g grated gruyère (optional - the original recipe doesn't include it)
- 3 eggs
- 250ml heavy cream
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- A pinch of nutmeg (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roll out the pastry in a buttered and floured tart pan. Prick the bottom with a fork to prevent it from puffing up during baking. Set aside.
3. In a pan over medium heat, sauté the bacon lardons until lightly golden. Drain them on paper towels to remove excess fat.
4. In a bowl, beat the eggs, then add the heavy cream. Season with salt, pepper, and optionally a pinch of grated nutmeg to flavor the mixture.
5. Distribute the bacon lardons on the tart base and sprinkle with grated gruyère.
6. Gently pour the egg and cream mixture over the lardons and cheese.
7. Bake the quiche in the preheated oven for about 30 to 40 minutes, until golden and the filling is set.
8. Once cooked, remove the quiche from the oven and let it cool slightly before cutting into slices.
