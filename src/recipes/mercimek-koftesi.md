# Mercimek köftesi

## Ingredients

- 1 cup red lentils
- 1.5 cups fine bulgur
- 1 onion
- 1 bunch parsley
- 2-3 tablespoons oil
- 1 bunch green onions
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste (you can use a mix of pepper and tomato paste)
- 3 cups water (add more if needed during kneading)
- Salt to taste
- Cumin
- Red pepper flakes
- Black pepper

## Directions

1. Wash the lentils and place in a suitable pot, add 3 cups of water. Boil until completely soft.
2. When the water is absorbed, add the bulgur and let it rest for half an hour with the lid closed.
3. In a separate pan, sauté finely chopped onion in oil until lightly pink, add tomato paste and sauté for 1-2 more minutes, then remove from heat.
4. Add the sautéed onion mixture to the rested lentils and knead well when it reaches a temperature that won't burn your hands.
5. Add salt and spices to the well-mixed köfte mixture and knead again.
6. Finally, add finely chopped parsley and finely chopped green onions. Mix well.
7. After the köfte mixture cools a bit, knead all ingredients by hand and tear off egg-sized pieces. Shape the köftes and arrange them on lettuce or arugula leaves.
